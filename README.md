# Aventus Improvement Proposals (AIPs)

Aventus Improvement Proposals (AIP) describes standards for the Aventus Ecosystem, including core protocol specifications and processes. These AIPs are technical communication processed off-chain and recognised formally. This is not a substitute for the governance process run here but it is a collection of sound and forward-thinking solutions and functionalities for the network. However, they do not represent a commitment of any form towards existing projects.

## Rationale

The intention here is for AIPs to be the primary mechanism for proposing solutions and new functionality by the community for the Aventus Network.

## Disclaimer

As of now, we loosely accept proposals that we might not actively endorse, do not expect to be implemented or might fall outside the scope of the AIP. We think many standards will be adopted organically (with some coordination) and change with time. We expect that a more firm process for standardization will evolve as adoption takes place. Certain proposals might be modified, replaced or deprecated.

## :pencil: Contributing

Before you start writing a formal AIP, you should make sure you've certain your proposal has not already been addressed in the most recent release. An AIP should provide the motivation as well as a technical specification for the feature.
