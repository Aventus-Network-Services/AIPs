# Aventus Improvement Proposals (AIPs)

Aventus Improvement Proposals (AIP) describes standards for the Aventus Ecosystem, including core protocol specifications and processes. These AIPs are technical communication processed off-chain and recognised formally. This is not a substitute for the governance process run here but it is a collection of sound and forward-thinking solutions and functionalities for the network. However, they do not represent a commitment of any form towards existing projects.

## Rationale

The intention here is for AIPs to be the primary mechanism for proposing solutions and new functionality by the community for the Aventus Network.

## Disclaimer

As of now, we loosely accept proposals that we might not actively endorse, do not expect to be implemented or might fall outside the scope of the AIP. We think many standards will be adopted organically (with some coordination) and change with time. We expect that a more firm process for standardization will evolve as adoption takes place. Certain proposals might be modified, replaced or deprecated.

- Core - Improvements to the components of the substrate build of the Aventus Network such as pallets.
- Layer 1 - Improvements to the smart contracts on Layer 1.
- Interface - Improvements to the communication mechanism between the Aventus blockchain and other blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Polkadot, etc.
- Ecosystem - Improvements to the various tools built on the network such as Explorer, Wallet, Governance, etc.

## :pencil: Contributing

Before you start writing a formal AIP, you should make sure you're certain your proposal has not already been addressed in the most recent release. An AIP should provide the motivation as well as a technical specification for the feature.

## :signal-strength: Proposal Stages  


|Status| Description |
| ----: | :------ |
| Draft | The idea has been formally accepted on the github repository by merging the draft into the submissions folder. |
| Community Review | The submitted proposal will be announced on various channels for 2 weeks OR The submitted proposal will be voted on by AVT holders. The result of the vote will either be accept or reject.  |
| Proposed | This has been tested in a sandbox environment and is believed to be working. Also, an approved plan to implement this on the mainnet has been constructed and accepted. Further changes are unlikely at this stage. |
| Active | The proposal is deemed to be working and has passed all checks and is now deployed on the Aventus mainnet. |
| On Hold | Work on this has been halted either due to the author/submitted putting the proposal on hold or a decision was made to halt it. |
| Obsolete | A more recent proposal supersedes it in capabilities and value. |
| Rejected | Concerns have been raised around the proposal. |


## Management  

This repository is managed frequently so you do not need to email/contact us to notify us of your submission. An appropriate reviewer with intimate knowledge of the subject area of the AIP will pick this up soon.
