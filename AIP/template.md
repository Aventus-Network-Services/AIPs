This is the suggested template for new AIPs.

Note that an AIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your AIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `aip-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

The title should be 44 characters or less. It should not repeat the AIP number in title, irrespective of the category.

## Abstract/Summary

A short paragraph providing technical summary or brief of the standard and the addressed issue(s). This abstract should be in human-readable format and should be as clear and concise as possible.

## Motivation

The motivation section should describe what motivated the development of the standard. Why should this standard be implemented? How does the Aventus ecosystem benefit from this standard. What prompted the decisions in this standard? What use cases does this standard address?

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

The specification section should describe the feature as detailed as possible. It should be well detailed describing the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The proposal should be complete, consistent, unambiguous, quantitative, and feasible.

## Backwards Compatibility

All AIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The AIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. AIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Tests

If applicable, please include a list of potential test cases to validate an implementation.

## Reference Implementation

An optional section that contains a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification. Previous accepted AIP numbers can also be used as reference here. 

## Copyright

Each AIP must be labeled as placed in the
