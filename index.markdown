# Aventus Improvement Proposals (AIPs)

AIP describes standards for the Aventus Ecosystem, including core protocol specifications and processes. These AIPs are technical communication processed off-chain and recognised formally. This is not a substitute for the governance process run [here](https://gov.aventus.io/#/) but it is a collection of sound and forward-thinking solutions and functionalities for the network. However, they do not represent a commitment of any form towards existing projects.

## Contributing

First review [AIP-0](./AIP/submissions/AIP-0). Then clone the repository and add your AIP to it. There is a [template AIP here](https://github.com/Aventus-Network-Services/AIPs/blob/master/AIP/template.md). Then submit a Pull Request to Aventus's [AIPs repository](https://github.com/Aventus-Network-Services/AIPs).

## AIP Process

The following is the standardization process for all AIPs in all tracks:

- **Draft** - The idea has been formally accepted on the github repository by merging the draft into the submissions folder.

- **Community review** - The submitted proposal will be announced on various channels for 2 weeks OR The submitted proposal will be voted on by AVT holders. The result of the vote will either be accept or reject.

- **Proposed** - This has been tested in a sandbox environment and is believed to be working. Also, an approved plan to implement this on the mainnet has been constructed and accepted. Further changes are unlikely at this stage.

- **Active** - The proposal is deemed to be working and has passed all checks and is now deployed on the Aventus mainnet.

- **On Hold** - Work on this has been halted either due to the author/submitted putting the proposal on hold or a decision was made to halt it.

- **Obsolete** - A more recent proposal supersedes it in capabilities and value.

- **Rejected** - Concerns have been raised around the proposal.

## AIP Types

There are five types of AIP:

- [Core](./core.html) ({{site.pages|where:"type","Core"|size}}) - Improvements to the components of the substrate build of the Aventus Network such as pallets and any other changes that affect the blockchain protocol. This includes changes to the block or transaction validity rules and other network protocol changes.

- [Layer 1](./layer_1.html) ({{site.pages|where:"type","Layer 1"|size}})  - Improvements to the smart contracts on Layer 1.

- [Interface](./interface.html) ({{site.pages|where:"type","Interface"|size}})  - Improvements to the communication mechanism between the Aventus blockchain and other blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Polkadot, etc. This also includes improvements around the client.

- [Ecosystem](./ecosystem.html) ({{site.pages|where:"type","Ecosystem"|size}})  - Improvements to the various tools built on the network such as Explorer, Wallet, Governance, etc.

- [Informational](./informational.html) ({{site.pages|where:"type","Informational"|size}})  - Describes an Aventus design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Aventus community, but does not propose a new feature.
