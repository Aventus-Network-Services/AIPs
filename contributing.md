[Here](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) is a more detailed guide on how to submit a pull request. Ensure your code runs without errors before submitting a pull request.

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors (including the maintainer(s) of the project):

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way. If you need to rebase, ensure you do it in your own repo.
2. **Non-master branches**, prefixed with a short name moniker (e.g. `<initials>-<feature>`) must be used for ongoing work.
3. **All modifications** must be made in a **pull-request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.


## Changes to this arrangement
This contribution guideline is subject to changes where it is believed that there is something valuable to add or change.

## Heritage

These contributing guidelines are modified from the "OPEN Open Source Project" guidelines for the Level project: [https://github.com/Level/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Level/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
